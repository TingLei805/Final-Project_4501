# Final Project_4501
## Description: 
In this project we explored data concerning searching for a suitable apartment in nyc. First we used website api to download data we needed for 311 complaints and trees that exist in the city. Then we combine data from zillow rent information and zip codes geometry to derive 4 rough data frames. Last but not least, we applied SQL to parse all the data and answer queries. Furthermore, we created visualization images to have a better understanding of our project data.
